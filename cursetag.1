.SH NAME
CurseTag - Curses based audio file tag editor
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "cursetag" DIRECTORY [-F|-R PATTERN]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
DIRECTORY is the directory in which to work. CurseTag only deals with the files in one single directory, and does not touch subdirectories.
.PP
If only a directory is provided, CurseTag runs in interactive mode. Files can be processed in a batch by giving either the -F or -R flag
followed by a pattern (more details below).
.PP
If a valid directory was given, CurseTag will read the files in that directory and list (interactive) or process (batch) them. If there are no recognised audio files in the directory, CurseTag exists.

.PP
.B "Tag/filename interaction"
.PP
It is also possible to read the tags automatically from the filenames, or rename the files according to the tags.
This is accomplished with a pattern string containing some of the following wildcards:
.TP 6
%t
track title
.TP
%A
artist
.TP
%a
album
.TP
%y
year
.TP
%n
track number
.TP
%c
comment
.PP
Anything besides these wildcards is interpreted literally. For instance, if the working directory is /home/user/music/Band/Albumname/ and the files are named "01. First Track.ogg" etc., the tags can be filled with the string "%A/%a/%n. %t.ogg".
.PP
Renaming files is limited to renaming them within the working directory; the directory structure is not touched.
.SH BATCH MODE
The batch mode can be used to rename files or fill tags automatically without interaction. The pattern string to use is given as the third and last command line argument. The second argument specifies what to do:
.TP 9
-F
Fill tags according to path&filename.
.TP
-R
Rename files based on tags.
.PP
Please be aware that the batch mode asks no questions and simply writes the tags or renames the files. Care should be taken in the invocation, and patterns should always be tested first in the interactive mode.
.PP
When renaming files in batch mode, execution will end at first encountered error. CurseTag will not overwrite existing files.
