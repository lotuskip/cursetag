Note to those familiar with versions < 6:
Cursetag, which I in my youthful folly wrote in C++, is now written entirely
in C. For more details on this, see the file CREWRITE. I thought of making
this a completely new project, which it really *is*, but didn't want to let go
of the name "CurseTag". So, in terms of "version management", I have chosen to
make this a new git branch. The old turd of a branch in C++ will not be
touched by me ever again.

Also in the news, the Swedes have, in the meantime, invented something called
Spotify. It rids one of the need for "files", as it were. Reportedly, some
people even use it.


INTRODUCTION

This is a sort of a _explanation_ of CurseTag. For compilation/installation
info, look at the Makefile; for usage info, see the man page.

CurseTag is a text-based audio file tag (metadata) editor. It was originally
created as a simplified, lightweight, non-graphical alternative for a GUI editor
called EasyTag.

Advantages of CurseTag over EasyTag:
	- fully keyboard driven interface
	- starts up about 10 times faster, if not more
	- runs in textmode, even without X
	- much more simple
	- can rename files & fill tags noninteractively, e.g. from scripts
For disadvantages, keep reading.


LIMITATIONS

The interface is fully keyboard driven.

Simplicity often implies a learning curve.

CurseTag relies on TagLib for reading&writing the tags; therefore any and all
limitations of TagLib apply. Refer to TagLib documentation for more.

CurseTag does not have any editable configuration. The colours can be configured
at compile time.

CurseTag does not try to be as smart as EasyTag. Some examples:
- Filetype detection is left entirely to TagLib. So don't ask me.
- All tags are read&written in UTF-8 only. Actually, things break if strings are
  not UTF-8. If you have files with tags in other encodings, I recommend
  clearing them first thing.
- All tag handling is done on the most generic level so the fine details of
  different file types are ignored. Only a basic set of tags is editable at all.

Finally, there might be some bugs. CurseTag might mess up your metadata or even
cause data loss, especially if used carelessly. Nothing serious has ever
happened to me, but you have been warned and I take no responsibility.


LICENSE

Nobody asked me if I like the Berne Convention; they just keep telling me to
include a Valid Legal License. Now, this is what I have to say: It is my
conviction - and I believe the proponents of "freedom of speech" have got my
back here - that every motherfucker has their own personal Belief System (BS)
which they [sub]consciously follow, and in the present instance, the BS of the
aforementioned tellers promotes what some{{who!?}} have named "permission
culture", which it is your right to look up on Wikipeepee for more
"information", and which I have previously declared to have everything to do
with Italian ancenstry, but nobody who happened to see that remark understood
it! Or at least they failed to let me know! Nevertheless, without causal, or
casual, connection to the preceding, it is imperative, nay, it is REQUIRED,
that any asshole who intends to PROFIT by sueing me in a court of "law"
thoroughly understands this entire paragraph and really this entire file (which,
of course, someone might have modified in some re-distribution of this piece of
"software") because I will be referring to various points of it in my
SUBSTANTIAL defense which will be airtight and GLORIOUSLY baffling and
SUBSTANTIALLY all-caps and FREE of hateful maliciousness. Irrigardless of all
that, any cocksucker who wants to use this piece of "software" to manipulate
the precious audio files they have pirated at some point in time should be
informed, and thus hopefully is, that nothing in life is certain.
